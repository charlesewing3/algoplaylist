The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock. Many critics consider Led Zeppelin one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.Originally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin's deal with Atlantic Records gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded \"Ramble On\" and \"Whole Lotta Love\". In 1970 they released Led Zeppelin III which featured \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. Houses of the Holy (1973) yielded \"The Ocean\", \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" and \"The Rain Song\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, featured \"Trampled Under Foot\" and \"Kashmir\".",

              "wTeaser": "Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, and became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.Pink Floyd grew out of a series of short-lived bands featuring musicians Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals) and Bob Klose (guitars).  Klose left in 1965, shortly before the erstwhile group of musicians began calling themselves \"The Pink Floyd Sound\", which was later shortened to just \"Pink Floyd\".  Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Barrett's deteriorating mental health led the band to invite guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour to join in December 1967, as the band were recording their follow up album A Saucerful of Secrets (1968); Barret would leave the band in April 1968., shortly before the release of the album.  The band recorded a number of experimental albums and film soundtracks in the early 1960s, including soundtracks to the films More and Zabriskie Point, the half-live, half-studio double album Ummagumma, and the experimental Atom Heart Mother.  This period is highlighted by the band's heavy use of non-musical sounds and experimental studio techniques known as musique concrète.  Their 1971 album Meddle represented an important transitional album as the band became more focused in their songwriting; it would be the last album written by the band collaboratively, as Roger Waters emerged the primary lyricist and thematic leader. \nStarting with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), the band began releasing a series of concept albums, each exploring a cohesive theme and narrative flow, continuing on with Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards.  Waters increasingly dictatorial control over the band alienated the other members, keyboardist Richard Wright was fired from the band during the production of The Wall, and the band continued as a three-piece for their next album, The Final Cut (1983).",

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\".Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"Hey Joe\", \"Purple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the US.  The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970.",

Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning nearly 60 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.Following his self-titled debut album in 1962, which mainly comprised traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan the following year. The album features \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\". For many of these songs, he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966).

They are sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is often known as the \"Toxic Twins\".Perry and Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with Tyler, Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith; in 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford. They released a string of multi-platinum albums starting with their eponymous debut in 1973, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974. The band broke into the mainstream with Toys in the Attic (1975) and Rocks (1976). Draw the Line and Night in the Ruts followed in 1977 and 1979. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles, including their first Top 40 hit \"Sweet Emotion\" and the Top 10 hits \"Dream On\" and \"Walk This Way\". By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". Drug addiction and internal conflict led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981.\nThe band did not fare well and the album Rock in a Hard Place (1982) failed to match previous successes.",

Belying their origins in the East Bay subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area, the band often played in a Southern rock style, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River and other elements of Southern United States iconography. The band's songs rarely dealt with romantic love, concentrating instead on political and socially conscious lyrics about topics such as the Vietnam War. The band performed at the 1969 Woodstock festival in Upstate New York, and was the first major act signed to appear there.",
